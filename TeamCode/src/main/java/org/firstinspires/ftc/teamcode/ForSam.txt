Sam, this is where I (Jayson) will be telling you things that must change, and what is
currently going on.

    1. We are using files that begin with "motor" such as motorAuto.java and motorTest.java. These
    two classes are the autonomous and telemetry-Op files, respectively. If you ever are confused about
    something in a file, WRITE IT HERE.
